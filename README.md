## General Information
Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to 
individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow
people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the 
user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be 
returned to another dock belonging to the same system.


A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their 
revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult 
to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful 
business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes 
to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among 
the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 
They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the 
situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make 
huge profits.


They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand 
for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting 
the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

How well those variables describe the bike demands

Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has 
gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 


## Conclusions
- The months - Jan, Sep should be considered by the company as they have a higher demand as compared to other months.
- With an increase in temperature the demand also increases, hence it should keep track of the weather conditions.
- During the Winter season the demand rises, hence it should be well prepared to meet the high demand

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all those who have supported and contributed 
to the successful completion of this Linear Regression Assignment. Firstly, I would like to thank 
the Automobile institution for providing access to the dataset and resources necessary for 
conducting this analysis. I am grateful for the guidance and mentorship provided by Upgrad 
Mentors. Their expertise and insights were invaluable in shaping the direction of the analysis. 
Finally, I extend my appreciation 
to the developers and contributors of the open-source tools and libraries that were utilized in 
this project. Their efforts have made Linear Regression more accessible and efficient. 
This project would not have been possible without the collective support and collaboration 
of all these individuals and organizations.
